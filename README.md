# EKFAttitude


### Introduction

This project involved reading and implementing the paper [file:///C:/Users/lenovo/Documents/Caltech/Attitude_EKF/attitudeEstimation.pdf] to extract estimates of Euler Angles of the UAV given the Differential GPS and IMU Data. The Euler Angle data will be used as an input parameter in testing a localization algorithm in the future.
