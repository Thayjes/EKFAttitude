### Introduction

This project involved reading and implementing a [publication](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oteLCGfOLS6JvO2vur0Xyd17OlLqJXE_) to extract estimates of Euler Angles of the UAV given the Differential GPS and IMU Data. The Euler Angle data will be used as an input parameter in testing a localization algorithm in the future.
